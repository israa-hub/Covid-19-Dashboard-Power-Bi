# COVID-19 Dashboard – Data Visualisation & Insight Group Project

### 📚 University Project – Data Visualisation and Insight Module

This project was completed as part of the **Data Visualisation and Insight** module during the **third year** of the **BSc in Mathematics and Data Science** at **Dundalk Institute of Technology (DkIT)**.  
This is a group project where I did the Power Bi dashboards and my teammate did the Tableau dashboard.
In this project I explores global **COVID-19 case data**, with a focus on visualising how the pandemic spread across countries using interactive dashboards using **Power Bi**
